# Hollywood Actor Movie (HAM) and Bacon
This was a project I created with classmates for the CSC111 course at the University of Toronto (UofT) in 2025. We were tasked with using the graph/tree data type and creating some sort of project that would display data/information in a neat way. We decided that movies were a fun concept, and that delving into the world of bacon numbers would bring forward some interesting results.

Here are some excerpts from the report we had to submit alongside our project that explain more about the project:

"On many websites, you can enter the names of two actors, and if a path exists, it will return something that looks a lot like a graph, showing the names of the actors and lines that connect to movies (and possibly other actors) between them in their path (Oracle of Bacon, n.d.).

Recognizing that the Bacon Number problem is represented as a graph helped us visualize how similar questions could be addressed using graph theory. Our initial thought was, could we somehow use this concept to understand which actors are the most influential? Understanding what it meant to be “influential” was difficult, but we eventually decided that “the most influential actors” would be ones with the lowest average bacon number.

This led to our main goal: **enabling users to compute Bacon numbers, visualize actor paths, and rank actors by their average Bacon number.** This became the backbone of our project and inspired us to implement one last major idea. ... we wanted to create a system to recommend movies based on intersecting cast members, which would relate to our bacon number idea. We even wanted to take this a step further and add a filtering system based on release date and ratings for the recommendations, which we also eventually implemented for the functionality of calculating the bacon paths."
